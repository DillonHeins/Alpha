\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
    This project is a Research Support System. Its main purpose is to keep track of many aspects that are regularly needed by researchers and a easy way for research heads or HOD of the respective facility to be able to see progress that has been made by the researchers in their team.
    
    Scope for this project is only the Computer Science department and its respective lecturers and leaders.
    General uses of this system should include keeping track of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Research Papers
        \item Reports, of which has different types
        \item Research Groups
        \item Running Costs
        \item Historical publications
        \item List of Authors
        \item List of Users
        \item Units 
    
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Testing}
        Software testing plays an important part of the software development pipeline and is necessary for creating maintainable and scalable programmes. It has many different objectives and goals but ultimately it comes down to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Finding defects in the program that was developed and possibly finding solutions to those problems
            \item To ensure the level of quality has been maintained throughout the program
            \item Find potential security flaws and vulnerabilities
            \item Ensuring usability
            \item Ensuring the program has lived up to the system requirements set out by the clients.
        \end{itemize}
    Testing ensures that the project, which should be in its final stages of development, is ready to be rolled out to the clients and that it meets the requests made by the clients. Thus certain fields of the program could be addressed. These fields are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Flexibility
            \item Maintainability
            \item Scalability
            \item Performance requirements
            \item Reliability
            \item Security
            \item Auditability
            \item Testability
            \item Usability
            \item Integrability
            \item Deployability
        \end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Alpha Reporting}
	The test cases were properlly set-up and worked correctly. JUnit was correctly used as a testing framework. Spring was also applied for dependancy injections. Bean Validation was also used. Both services contracts; getAccreditationUnitReportRequest and getProgressReportRequest were tested for both valid and invalid requests using mock object generated by the Reporting section programming team and worked as expected. \\
  
  \section{Publication functionality}
  	\subsection{Woking functionality}
		The integration functionality to get a publication works, it takes in a json object request and returns a response with is a json object.if the publication does not exist the is a catch an exception or if the request in not valid it will catch an exception. for that they use a rest layer. This is the only functionality implemented by the integration team for publication.
	\subsection{Short Comings for implemented functionality}
		There were no short commings in the get pulbication function

	\subsection{Missing functionality}
		There is no other functionality to modify a publication such as to change publication state ,add publication type, modify publication type and also to getPublicationForPerson,getPublicationForGroup and calculate Accreditation points for both group and person.

\section{Front-end Interfaces: Web and Android Development}
        Front end developers were tasked to use information from the back-end, such as database objects and requests and display it in a way that is user friendly to the user and intuitive for the designer. The interface also needs to provide the user easy tools to make requests to the back-end without the user having to worry about actual functionality of the system.

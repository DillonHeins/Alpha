\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
    This project is a Research Support System. Its main purpose is to keep track of many aspects that are regularly needed by researchers and a easy way for research heads or HOD of the respective facility to be able to see progress that has been made by the researchers in their team.
    
    Scope for this project is only the Computer Science department and its respective lecturers and leaders.
    General uses of this system should include keeping track of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Research Papers
        \item Reports, of which has different types
        \item Research Groups
        \item Running Costs
        \item Historical publications
        \item List of Authors
        \item List of Users
        \item Units 
    
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Testing}
        Software testing plays an important part of the software development pipeline and is necessary for creating maintainable and scalable programmes. It has many different objectives and goals but ultimately it comes down to:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Finding defects in the program that was developed and possibly finding solutions to those problems
            \item To ensure the level of quality has been maintained throughout the program
            \item Find potential security flaws and vulnerabilities
            \item Ensuring usability
            \item Ensuring the program has lived up to the system requirements set out by the clients.
        \end{itemize}
    Testing ensures that the project, which should be in its final stages of development, is ready to be rolled out to the clients and that it meets the requests made by the clients. Thus certain fields of the program could be addressed. These fields are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Flexibility
            \item Maintainability
            \item Scalability
            \item Performance requirements
            \item Reliability
            \item Security
            \item Auditability
            \item Testability
            \item Usability
            \item Integrability
            \item Deployability
        \end{itemize}
\section{Functional Testing}
    \subsection{Reporting}
        \subsubsection{Implementation}
        The integration system gains access to the reporting module via an interface called IReporting. This provides the system with two functions, each to get a different category of report (Progress or Accreditation Unit). The team has implemented all the functions necessary to integrate the Reporting module and all functions run as expected. Comprehensive unit tests have been written by the Alpha team and all tests pass - this includes tests which execute a request for a report without trouble, as well as requests which expect exceptions. The Alpha Team has implemented custom Exceptions for invalid Report parameters among other things, and these Exceptions are caught and handled accordingly. The integration of the reporting module includes a REST layer which consumes a JSON Object (request) and generates a Response instance to return. They utilized the Spring framework for dependency injection and stateless entity beans are used for the different entities.
        \subsubsection{Short-comings}
        There does not appear to be any shortcomings in the integration of the reporting system.
        \subsubsection{Missing}
        There are no functions missing.
        
    \subsection{Notifications}
        \subsubsection{Implementation}
        Unit tests were performed for all the functionality within the notification module.Dependency injection was used through the spring framework and everything worked.J unit was used accordingly and all the test cases that were written passed.
        \subsubsection{Short-comings}
        There are no short comings, all functionality specified by the specification were implemented.
        \subsubsection{Missing}
        
    \subsection{People}
        \subsubsection{Implementation}
        The people module is accessed via an interface specified as IPeople. This is then implemented in the defaultImpl package where all methods return null, enabling the system to compile and pass all build tests. The functionality of the People module has been extensively mocked and tested withing the testing framework. Expected values were checked to make sure the correct objects were being handled and returned. They were sure to include all the exceptions that needed be thrown if an error occurred and showed comprehensive use of the assert library functions. Alpha Integration had an extensive exception library, making sure to have an exception class for each and every possible exception that may occur. The seamless integration of this module is apparent that the layout was well thought out. A request object is sent in, encapsulating various necessary information to perform a function. A response object is returned to notify the system of the status of the function's execution.
        \subsubsection{Short-comings}
        Short-comings aren't present in the testing and integration of the People module. Everything was covered to the edge and beyond.
        \subsubsection{Missing}
        There are no functions missing.
        
    \subsection{Publications}
        \subsubsection{Implementation}
            The integration functionality to get a publication works, it takes in a JSON object request and returns a response with is a JSON object.if the publication does not exist the is a catch an exception or if the request in not valid it will catch an exception. for that they use a rest layer. This is the only functionality implemented by the integration team for publication.
        \subsubsection{Short-comings}
        There were no short comings in the get publication function
        \subsubsection{Missing}
        There is no other functionality to modify a publication such as to change publication state ,add publication type, modify publication type and also to getPublicationForPerson,getPublicationForGroup and calculate Accreditation points for both group and person.
        
    \subsection{Interface}
        \subsubsection{Implementation}
        The integration functionality, in terms of integrating the rest of the back-end with the interface or front-end for both the web interface and android, was to have communication between the front and back-ends through AJAX calls to get or post new information to be displayed or stored. The web interface used ember and mirage server to handle the calls and create a mock database. Requests are made through user interaction which will send either GET requests if the user wants to retrieve information to display your use and will use POST requests if the user wants to update the database. other requests such as PUT, PATCH and DELETE which is needed to be compliant with the RESTful API.
        \subsubsection{Short-comings}
        Since the integration team did not implement any integration of front and back-end, there was no code to test.
        \subsubsection{Missing}
        There is no functionality put in place for the integration of web or android code with any of the other back-end modules and so the section as a whole is missing.

\section{Architectural Compliance}
    \subsection{Reporting}
        \subsubsection{Quality Requirements}
            \paragraph{Flexibility}
            Due to the independence between the integration module and the reporting module, this part of the system is quite flexible. One could swap out the reporting module for a different system without too much trouble, if requests are still sent in an appropriate format (JSON). This is enhanced with the dependency injection used.
            \paragraph{Maintainability}
            The system is poorly documented, which makes maintenance more difficult for a third-party developer. On the other hand, the system uses technologies we believe will be in regular use for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, despite the lack of documentation, the system does have a rather logical structure which should assist a new developer in understanding the system. Maintainability is, however, slightly hampered by the main Reporting interface, since it requires a unique function for each report category and adding a category may be difficult.
            \paragraph{Scalability}
            \paragraph{Performance requirements}
            \paragraph{Reliability}
            \paragraph{Security}
            \paragraph{Auditability}
            There is no logging functionality evident withing the reporting integration itself. Exceptions are thrown, but are either caught and ignored, or caught in the unit tests. Successes are not logged, and it does not seem any other activity is either. Calls to services are, however logged, higher up in the system but these are not specific to the reporting.
            \paragraph{Testability}
            This system is testable with built-in unit tests - as requested in the master spec. There are mock objects provided for unit testing and integration testing.
            \paragraph{Usability}
            \paragraph{Integrability}
            \paragraph{Deployability}

        \subsubsection{Software Architecture Not Adhered}       
        
\section{Publication Architecture Compliance}
    \subsection{Flexibility}
    The integration code complies to this requirement because it has the ability to deploy different versions of the system with as little down-time as possible. This is partly due to the decoupled nature of the integration and publication sections. The code also makes use of dependency injection for contract based software development.
    
    \subsection{Maintainability}
    The code has very little to no documentation, which makes it very difficult for developers that did not on the system initially to be able to understand the code.
    
    \subsection{Scalability}
    The system is able to store a large amount of the department's publication meta data on the database without any difficulty.
    
    \subsection{Performance Requirements}
    All the the services of Publication operate within the required time of 0.2 seconds.
    
    \subsection{Auditability}
    The system does not log any of the requests, responses and exceptions of the publication services.
    
    
    \subsection{Reliability}
    The service requests are fully implemented and can be fully executed for each service contract for the publication section. It also supports commit and rollback functionality for the database.
    
    \subsection{Security}
    The integration code does not check the authorisation of the user for the services that only should be used by specific users. For example, the addPublicationType service should only allow administrators to use it. This is not implemented.
    
    \subsection{Testability}
    Junit is used for out-of-container testing to test the publication section. Embedded container unit testing is not used, however, this is listed as a nice-to-have.
